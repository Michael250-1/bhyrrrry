			Arts Program School
			El Oro Way has the privilege of being an Arts Program School. This program brings high quality arts instruction in all three disciplines; dance, theater and visual arts. All teachers have been trained by art specialists who teach at our school. The goal of the program is to promote and implement a comprehensive visual and performing arts program available to all students. All teachers integrate the arts into their regular curriculum to provide students with a well-rounded and enriched educational program. Teachers and students alike have been enjoying this expressive program at our school and hope to continue our partnership for years to come.

			Wonder of Reading Library
			El Oro Way celebrated the grand opening of our Wonder of Reading Library in November 2006. The newly expanded library features a story amphitheater, study cubbies, and even a cozy reading nook complete with fireplace. Additionally, we are currently working on completing our Reading Garden, located just outside the library. This outdoor setting will include a stage area, small grass lawn area, and multiple tables and benches to bring the pleasures of reading outdoors.
			<br>
			<br>
			Our highly trained and dedicated teachers provide a rigorous curriculum and focus on the individual needs of all students. Because of our small student population, at just over 500 students, our office and teaching staff get to know all the children personally. At El Oro Way, everyone is family. In fact, over twenty percent of our current staff first came to El Oro Way as a either a parent or student and went on to become a permanent part of the El Oro Way family.

			Our school has a successful GATE program in grades three through five which offer advanced classes to enrich the curriculum for our large GATE population. Academic opportunities for our diverse student population include learning to a play musical instrument, serving on the student council, participating in various extracurricular clubs, contributing to the school newspaper, and participating in the California Science Olympiad. We also provide exceptional support for students with special needs, including our innovative High Functioning Autism program.

			Our exceptionally loyal and hard working PTA further strengthens our school. The parents at El Oro Way are extremely supportive and involved. They have successfully raise funds every year to enable children to receive a well-rounded education that have included PE instruction from a credentialed physical education teacher, fieldtrips, computer lab assistant, and supplemental supplies. Additionally, our parents and community members help maintain our beautiful outdoor learning habitat and help make school-wide events successful.

		<h2>Campus Life</h2>
		<p>
			We have many places on campus like the classrooms and offices but probobly the most notable is the Natural Habitat.Our parent, teacher, and administrative leadership were determined to see El Oro Way become a California Distinguished School. Perhaps the most visible example of our commitment to excellence on campus was the conversion of what was a neglected piece of land immediately adjacent to the school into an extensive “outdoor classroom.” This was a multi-year project that began with the process of acquiring the land, clearing the land, and develping the land, all undertaken entirely through El Oro Way community volunteers.


			The Habitat and its community volunteers have received support and several special recognitions from the Los Angeles City Council. The Habitat was chosen by Los Angeles City's Mayor, Jim Hahn, as the site on which to announce his 2004 city-wide conservation initiative.A unique learning opportunity at El Oro Way:

			The El Oro Way Schoolyard Habitat provides an opportunity for focus on environmental science. It is used in conjunction with math and science units at every grade level and is also used as a laboratory for articulation of the language arts, and most recently, of student photographic art as well. The Habitat provides a concrete opportunity for learners to develop their individual and social sense of responsibility, including respect for the conservation
